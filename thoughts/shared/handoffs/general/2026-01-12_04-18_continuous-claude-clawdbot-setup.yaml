goal: Merged Continuous Claude with OPC and implemented Clawdbot phases 4-8
now: Build Zoho Cliq provider and install macOS/iOS apps for Phase 7

test: docker exec opc-postgres psql -U opc -d opc -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sessions"

done_this_session:
  - task: Fixed OPC + Continuous Claude database merge
    files: [~/.opc/init-db.sql, ~/.opc/docker-compose.yml]
  - task: Added sessions and file_claims tables to OPC schema
    files: [~/.opc/init-db.sql]
  - task: Fixed hook connection strings (claude:claude_dev → opc:opc_dev_password)
    files: [~/.claude/hooks/src/shared/db-utils-pg.ts, ~/.claude/hooks/dist/*.mjs]
  - task: Started OPC docker stack (postgres, pgbouncer, redis)
    files: [~/.opc/docker-compose.yml]
  - task: Updated cross-terminal-db.md global rule
    files: [~/.claude/rules/cross-terminal-db.md]
  - task: Reconnected WhatsApp provider (was disconnected 13h)
    files: []
  - task: Phase 4 - Added channel routing bindings for 3 agents
    files: [~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json]
  - task: Phase 6 - Created standup skill
    files: [~/clawd/skills/standup/SKILL.md]
  - task: Phase 8 - Enabled browser automation
    files: [~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json]

blockers:
  - Phase 7 requires macOS app (clawdbot-mac) not installed
  - Phase 7 requires iOS app for mobile pairing (not installed)
  - Phase 5 (Zoho Cliq) needs provider built from scratch

questions:
  - What Zoho Cliq API endpoints to use for inbound/outbound?
  - Should Zoho Cliq use webhook or polling?

decisions:
  - unified_database: Merged continuous_claude into OPC database (opc:opc_dev_password@5432/opc)
  - routing_config: All 3 agents (Zuri/Atlas/Byte) bound to WhatsApp provider

findings:
  - hook_mismatch: Hooks expected continuous_claude db but OPC uses opc db - fixed
  - whatsapp_disconnect: Provider was disconnected, needed providers login to reconnect
  - agents_by_name: Agents activated by identity name mention (Zuri, Atlas, Byte)

worked:
  - Using sed for bulk connection string replacement in dist files
  - Running init-db.sql manually after docker up to create missing tables
  - daemon restart to pick up config changes

failed:
  - Docker Desktop became unresponsive mid-session, needed restart

next:
  - Build Zoho Cliq provider (src/providers/cliq/)
  - Install clawdbot-mac for voice wake
  - Install iOS app and pair device (clawdbot nodes approve)
  - Test standup skill via WhatsApp
